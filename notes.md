# Basic Stats in R

  No issues with R, every graphs loaded without any issues at all. ![Image](Tene_Piechart.png) ![Image](Tene_Bargraph.png) ![Image](Pithouse_Bargraph.png)
  
  I played with the code to make my own graphs using our Graveyard Project data which you can find [here](https://github.com/Circe99/Week-Five/blob/main/R-code). 
  
  First I did two graphs for data on the denomination because I was curious to see what was most common/how many people were able to answer this one (since my answers were based on what my friend told me and he works there). ![Image](Deno_Piechart.png) ![Image](Deno_Bargraph.png)
  
  Then I decided to make the same two graphs using data for the Date of Monument ![Image](Date_Piechart.png) ![Image](Date_Bargraph.png)
  
  And lastly I tried Types of Quotes ![Image](Quote_Piechart.png) ![Image](Quote_Bargraph.png)
  
  I'm pretty happy with the first set, it's pretty easy to read, though it's missing some labels (which I would have to go in and add myself if I wanted to, but I decided to leave it so that you could see the original) 
  The second set turned out exactly how I expected, the pie chart was not at all a good choice for this amount of data, but the bar graph was much better because of how it shows the amount over time. I don't know how to make a graph with both the date and the denomination (but that would have been my next try if I could do it).
  The last set was similar to the first one, it worked out ok but there are clearly missing labels which is unfortunate, but an easy fix. Had my data been closer in terms of numbers it may have been harder, but luckily the numbers were pretty different. 
  
  Overall I don;t have too much to say in terms of using RStudio, it was pretty straightforward. However, I will say the data we collected it very weirdly organized/labelled/missing info, so it was hard to make graphs that made sense. I had wanted to do one on the material, but because the responces were umbers instead of words I didn't think the graph would be as easilly legible.

  As you can see these charts harder to read because there is no legend to tell us what the numbers mean. So I would have to provide the sheets that we based our data submition on.

# RStudio Taken to the Next Level!

  Not going to lie, these graphs are super cool and I have no clue how to recreate them with the Graveyard Project data. But nonetheless I will try at leat try the 3D one cause it was by far my favourite. Here is the one provided by Dr.Graham ![Image](3D_Graph.png)
  
  My attempt will be coping the [code](https://github.com/Circe99/Week-Five/new/main) and filling in the parts I need. As I suspected, I was unable to get the graph I wanted. The first error message I got was ![Image](RStudio_Error.png)
  
  I googled my error message and found this [link](https://community.rstudio.com/t/warning-message-data-set-not-found/28025), but I am not sure which package I need for this set of data, so I don't know how to proceed.
