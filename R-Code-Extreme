# We're going to focus on visualizing more complex data this week - where we want to see three or more variables. 
# Let's use the DartPoints dataset in archdata. 
data(graveyards)

# And take a look at the dataframe
View(graveyards)

# We want to visualize three numerical variables in this dataset: Length of the points, Width of the points, 
# Thickness of the points. We'll use the scatterplotMatrix from RcmdrMisc. We've use scatterplots in the past but 
# this matrix allows us to see multiple variables at once. This matrix will show three variables, with six scatter plots,
# and three kernel density plots. Kernel density shows the distribution of numerical counts of a single variable: 
# they can be normally distributed or skewed one way or another - this tells us something about the data.

scatterplotMatrix(~Height..including.any.base..in.mm+Width..excluding.any.base..in.mm+Thickness.lenght..excluding.any.base., graveyards, smooth=FALSE)

# You might ask, why are there six plots but only three variables? Good question. There are two plots for every two
# variables - they just switch which is the x axis and which is the y axis. See if you can figure out which is which.

# Export this scatterplot matrix as an image and save/download it - you'll upload to this week's GitHub repo. 

# Now, what if we want to add in another variable, a categorical variable: the type of point (Darl, Ensor, etc.)
# This can show us how the different point types change in terms of the three numerical variables we plotted. 
scatterplotMatrix(~Height..including.any.base..in.mm+Width..excluding.any.base..in.mm+Thickness.lenght..excluding.any.base. | Name, graveyards, smooth=FALSE, diagonal=list(method="boxplot"), cex.labels=1.25, cex=.8)

# Let's look at what each part of the command means: we see the three variables we want, Name tells R that we want
# to separate the variable "Name", smooth=FALSE means we don't want a smoothing line, diagonal=list(method="boxplot") tells R
# we want boxplots as our diagonal graphs, cex.labels is the size of text, cex is the size of points. 

# Export this new scatterplot matrix bith boxplots as an image and save/download it - you'll upload to this week's GitHub repo. 

# Good, now let's try another way to visualize three numerical variables and one categorical variable. 
# First, we'll install the scatterplot3D package.
install.packages("scatterplot3d")
library(scatterplot3d)

# We'll first create a value called shapes. This is a vector from plotting characters (shapes) 21-25.
shapes <- 21:25

# Then we'll create a list - the command is complicated. I recommend looking at the function description to indentify each
# part of the command - alternatively, you can try removing or changing some of the factors and see what changes.

# The last thing to add is the legend.
