# Principle: Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies

  '“Women in poor countries seem to be asked about 6 times a day what kind of contraception they use,” Seager quipped in a lecture at the Boston Public Library. “But they are not asked about whether they have access to abortion. They are not asked about what sports they like to play.”'
  
  "The Golden Gate Bridge is a physical structure; Facebook ads are a virtual structure; and the gender binary is a conceptual one. But all these structures were created by people: people living in a particular place, at a particular time, and who were influenced—as we all are—by the world around them."
  
  Above are just a couple of quotes that stuck with me while I was reading this text. The first thing I felt was anger, escpecially when I read the first quote. It upset me so much to see in writing something that I unfortunatly already knew. It is so easy for people to catagorize people so that they fit into nice little boxes, just like with book genres, sings, and architectural tyepes. It makes it easier for our minds to understand something if we have something to compare it to, which is why the second quote was so important as well. The second quote highlights the need for us (all people) so create systems that can be used to place people into. The problem with this is when we find something (or someone) that doesn't quite fit. Instead of creating a new box (or just forgetting about the boxes altogether) we try to fit it in an already existing box based on the criteria that is closest. But this then means that the things that make this new thing different are removed/ignored, which is data that we then lose. 
 
  I'm going to be honest, this was extremely frustrating to read, but I still enjoyed it because (I believe) it did exactly what it was meant to. Bring awarness to the issue.
